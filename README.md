# Problems
I have a CSV file that contains a log of trading activity including opening long and short positions for different assets. I've written a python script that prints the daily realized profit/loss for each asset, only on days where there are trades placed. I don't care to calcualte unrealized profit/loss, I'm only looking at realized profit/loss.

When I run the python script, the output is very close to correct values, however when I manually check the calculations they are off by small amounts. I'm unable to figure out where the issue is in the python script. Your job is to find the problem and fix it.

I've attached the files for your review. I'm looking to have this project completed immediately. Only apply for the job if you can start on it right now. Let me know if you have any questions.
